= Spring Cloud Microservice Java Pipeline

This repo contains an `opinionated pipeline` to deploy a Spring Cloud based microservice.
We've taken the following opinionated decisions:

- usage of Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner and Spring Cloud Eureka
- usage of Maven Wrapper
- artifacts deployment by `./mvnw clean deploy`
- application deployment to Cloud Foundry
- running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` Maven profile
- running e2e tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` Maven profile

This is the initial approach that can be easily changed since all the core
deployment logic is done in a form of bash scripts.

You can go through the setup for

- <<jenkins, Jenkins using Jenkins Job DSL plugin>>
- <<concourse, Concourse>>

Each of these setups are available under the folders `jenkins` and
`concourse` respectively.
